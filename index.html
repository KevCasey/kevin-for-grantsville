      <h2>Meet Kevin</h2>
      
    

    <div style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1rem 1rem; width: 160px;">
      <img src="ProfilePic.jpg" alt="Kevin Casey" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);" />

<div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>Kevin Casey – Candidate for Grantsville City Council</strong><br />
        <em>Combat Disabled Veteran • Technology Leader • Advocate for Transparent, Accountable Government</em></p>
      </div>
<p>Kevin Casey is a U.S. Army veteran and a seasoned technology executive with more than 30 years of experience securing systems and advising organizations at the highest levels of national defense and commercial enterprise. Having worked with the Department of Defense, Fortune 500 companies, financial institutions, and leading cryptocurrency firms, Kevin has earned a reputation as a principled, results-driven leader focused on integrity, security, and service.</p>
<p>Now a resident of Grantsville, Kevin is running for City Council with a clear purpose: to restore trust in local government by ensuring that it serves the people—not itself. He believes that transparency, accountability, and public access are not optional—they are the foundations of freedom and fiscal responsibility.</p>
<p>Kevin brings a lifetime of public service, cybersecurity expertise, and leadership to the table. His campaign isn’t about politics—it’s about restoring responsible government, listening to citizens, and delivering honest, accountable leadership for Grantsville.</p>

      <p><strong>His priorities for Grantsville include:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Promoting full transparency in city budgeting, contracts, and council decisions</li>
        <li>Ensuring taxpayers know how their money is spent and why</li>
        <li>Expanding public access to meetings, records, and elected officials</li>
        <li>Using technology to make local government more open and responsive</li>
        <li>Strengthening public safety and infrastructure while protecting individual liberties</li>
      </ul>
    
    
    <p>Kevin is a proud father of two beautiful daughters and grandfather to eight precious grandchildren. He shares his life with his wonderful wife, Missy, whose support and love have been a foundation of his leadership and service.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: bold; color: #013220; margin-top: 2rem;">It would be my honor and pleasure to serve the citizens and taxpayers of Grantsville City.</p>

      <h2>Budget Accountability</h2>
      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Population vs. Spending:</strong> Grantsville’s population has grown by approximately 11% over the past three years. However, city budgets have grown by over 20% in many departments—including more than 25% increases in areas like engineering services and public works.
      </div>
      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>What's Missing:</strong> Many spending resolutions—such as police wage increases or beautification contracts—were passed without any dollar amounts disclosed to the public.
      </div>

      <h2>Key Issues</h2>

      <h3>City Debt</h3>
      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Did you know?</strong> As of the end of fiscal year 2024, Grantsville City holds <strong>$19,073,428</strong> in total outstanding debt.
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Revenue Bonds:</strong> $12,768,512 — secured by city revenue sources</li>
        <li><strong>Remaining Debt:</strong> $6.3 million — includes building leases and equipment financing</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>FY2026 Debt Service Costs:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Justice Center:</strong> $73,000 principal + $55,900 interest</li>
          <li><strong>Fire Department:</strong> $72,000 principal + $36,680 interest</li>
          <li><strong>Library:</strong> $98,000 principal + $37,250 interest</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>These payments total over <strong>$372,000 annually</strong> — and that’s before factoring in new projects. If new infrastructure is financed with bonds, it could increase this obligation significantly.</p>
      <p><strong>As your Councilmember</strong>, I will ensure all new debt proposals are publicly posted with full cost, interest, and long-term impacts disclosed in plain language.</p>

      <h3>Transparency</h3>
      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Did you know?</strong> Most of the resolutions passed by the City Council don’t list the actual cost of the proposals.
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>Citizens are expected to trust what they can’t see. I will push for full fiscal transparency on every resolution.</li>
        <li>Meeting minutes rarely reference the financial impact of approved actions.</li>
        <li>Budget categories are often broad, with little detail available to taxpayers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I will push for itemized cost estimates, publicly accessible procurement breakdowns, and digital dashboards so every citizen knows where their money goes.</p>

      <h3>Community Growth</h3>
      <p><em>Details coming soon.</em> This section will highlight the pace and impact of Grantsville’s population and housing growth, and the need for better planning, infrastructure coordination, and citizen input.</p>
