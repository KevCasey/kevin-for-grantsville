      <h2>Meet Kevin</h2>
      <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>Kevin Casey – Candidate for Grantsville City Council</strong><br />
        <em>Combat Disabled Veteran • Technology Leader • Advocate for Transparent, Accountable Government</em></p>
      </div>
      <p>Kevin Casey is a U.S. Army veteran and a seasoned technology executive with more than 30 years of experience securing systems and advising organizations at the highest levels of national defense and commercial enterprise...</p>
      <p><strong>His priorities for Grantsville include:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Promoting full transparency in city budgeting, contracts, and council decisions</li>
        <li>Ensuring taxpayers know how their money is spent and why</li>
        <li>Expanding public access to meetings, records, and elected officials</li>
        <li>Using technology to make local government more open and responsive</li>
        <li>Strengthening public safety and infrastructure while protecting individual liberties</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Budget Accountability</h2>
      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Population vs. Spending:</strong> Grantsville’s population has grown by approximately 11% over the past three years. However, city budgets have grown by over 20% in many departments—including more than 25% increases in areas like engineering services and public works.
      </div>
      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>What's Missing:</strong> Many spending resolutions—such as police wage increases or beautification contracts—were passed without any dollar amounts disclosed to the public.
      </div>

    <section>
      <h2>Key Issues</h2>

      <h3>City Debt</h3>
      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Did you know?</strong> As of the end of fiscal year 2024, Grantsville City holds <strong>$19,073,428</strong> in total outstanding debt.
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Revenue Bonds:</strong> $12,768,512 — secured by city revenue sources</li>
        <li><strong>Remaining Debt:</strong> $6.3 million — includes building leases and equipment financing</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>FY2026 Debt Service Costs:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Justice Center:</strong> $73,000 principal + $55,900 interest</li>
          <li><strong>Fire Department:</strong> $72,000 principal + $36,680 interest</li>
          <li><strong>Library:</strong> $98,000 principal + $37,250 interest</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>These payments total over <strong>$372,000 annually</strong> — and that’s before factoring in new projects. If new infrastructure is financed with bonds, it could increase this obligation significantly.</p>
      <p><strong>As your Councilmember</strong>, I will ensure all new debt proposals are publicly posted with full cost, interest, and long-term impacts disclosed in plain language.</p>

      <h3>Transparency</h3>
      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Did you know?</strong> Most of the resolutions passed by the City Council don’t list the actual cost of the proposals.
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>Citizens are expected to trust what they can’t see. I will push for full fiscal transparency on every resolution.</li>
        <li>Meeting minutes rarely reference the financial impact of approved actions.</li>
        <li>Budget categories are often broad, with little detail available to taxpayers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I will push for itemized cost estimates, publicly accessible procurement breakdowns, and digital dashboards so every citizen knows where their money goes.</p>

      <h3>Community Growth</h3>
      <p><em>Details coming soon.</em> This section will highlight the pace and impact of Grantsville’s population and housing growth, and the need for better planning, infrastructure coordination, and citizen input.</p>
